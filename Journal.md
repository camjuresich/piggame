# Febuary 5 2022

I have decided that I will start applying for jobs by September. 

## what have I learned today

- I learned that zsh uses a different file for aliases than that of bash.
- the tilde denotes the home directory 
- && works the same way as bash as zsh (run multiple commands in a single line)

## what shall I do today?

[x] work on the css of the pig game
[] write a winning function
[] dream up next steps to make the game multiplayer and dreamable features
